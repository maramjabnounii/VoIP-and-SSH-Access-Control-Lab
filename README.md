# VoIP-and-Secure-SSH-Configuration-Lab
This lab project simulates a network environment in Cisco Packet Tracer, focusing on VLAN segmentation, inter-VLAN routing via Router-on-a-Stick, and VoIP with IP phones across VLANs. Key configurations include VTP for VLAN management, DHCPv4 for IP assignment, DTP for trunk negotiation, and SSH for secure remote access.

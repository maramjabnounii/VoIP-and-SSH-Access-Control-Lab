# VoIP-and-Secure-SSH-Configuration-Lab
This lab project simulates a network environment using Cisco Packet Tracer with a focus on VLAN segmentation, inter-VLAN routing via Router-on-a-Stick, and VoIP setup. The topology includes VLAN configurations, DHCP for IP assignment, and VoIP with IP phones connected to different VLANs. 
Key protocols and configurations include:

VTP (VLAN Trunking Protocol) for VLAN management
VLANs for network segmentation
Trunk and Access Ports for VLAN traffic management
Dynamic Trunking Protocol (DTP) for trunk negotiation
Router-on-a-Stick configuration for inter-VLAN routing
DHCPv4 for automatic IP allocation
VoIP configuration with Cisco IP Phones
SSH setup for secure remote access
